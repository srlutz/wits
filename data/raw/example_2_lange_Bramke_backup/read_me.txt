Data from the lange Bramke catchment.
Input measurements from the stations in Ottawa, Stuttgart, Braunschweig and lange Bramke (for the stable isotopes between 1983 and 1986).
The input time series for the stable isotopes is the one from Braunschweig corrected for altitude using the precipitation data from the lange Bramke station by substracting the difference in the means of both stations from the Braunschweig measurements.
