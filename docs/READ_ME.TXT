###------------ Reports, guides and manuals for WITS --------------- ###

This folder contains the different reports and manuals prepared by working group 3 of the COST Action CA19120: WATer isotopeS in the critical zOne (WATSON) meant to accompany the use of the R code WITS.
This includes:
1- the WITS user manual (DOC_WATSON_WG3_WITS-user-manual_241120_1.0.pdf) describing the code structure and detailing all available modelling options.
2- the WITS beginner's guide (DOC_WATSON_WG3_WITS_beginners-guide_242210_1.0.pdf) introducing the use of WITS with a simple example.
3- the complete report on the use of environmental isotopes to estimate tracer transit times and storage in hydrological systems with the help of input-output models (RAP_WATSON-WG3-Input-output-modelling_final-report-JFA_240821_2.0.pdf) presenting the theoretical background of input-output modelling as well as illustrative case studies and a modelling guide.
4- a quick guide to sampling stable isotopes (DOC_WATSON_WG3-quick guide to sampling for stable isotopes of water_241016_0.2.pdf).

Also included is the IAEA TECDOC report 910 by Piotr Maloszewski and Andrzej Zuber (https://inis.iaea.org/records/q3yd3-v8t07, accessed April 17th 2025) which to the knowledge of the WITS authors is the most comprehensive and systematic presentation of input-output models, possibilities and limitations available. The additional modelling options offered by the use of the storage selections functions, for obvious chronological reasons not covered in this latter document, are presented in details in the final report of WATSON's WG 3 (document 3 above).
